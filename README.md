Studied 6-7 research papers for this project. The information was then gathered from secondary sources. Python is used to run the ARIMA Model for the dataset collected. The ARIMA model was executed step by step to get the future predicted trends and results. The ARIMA model is a type of time series model that can be used to predict future values of a time series based on its past values. These statistics can be used to assess whether the residuals are normally distributed and have constant variance, which are assumptions of the ARIMA model.
